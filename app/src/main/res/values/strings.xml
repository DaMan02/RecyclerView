Scroll view may have only one direct child placed within it. To add multiple views within the scroll view, make the direct child you add a view group, for example LinearLayout, and place additional views within that LinearLayout. Scroll view supports vertical scrolling only. For horizontal scrolling, use HorizontalScrollView instead. Never add a RecyclerView or ListView to a scroll view. Doing so results in poor user interface performance and a poor user experience. For vertical scrolling, consider NestedScrollView instead of scroll view which offers greater user interface flexibility and support for the material design scrolling patterns. To learn more about material design patterns for handling scrolling, see Scrolling techniques.</string>
